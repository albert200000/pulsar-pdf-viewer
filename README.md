# pulsar-pdf-viewer

pulsar-pdf-viewer is a package for the [Pulsar editor](https://pulsar-edit.dev) that makes it possible to view PDF files in Pulsar panes. It is a wrapper around Mozilla's [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) library including its viewer application, adapted for the Pulsar environment.

## Installation

Install from Pulsar's Settings/Install dialog (search for `pulsar-pdf-viewer`) or via `ppm install pulsar-pdf-viewer`.


## Usage

PDF files can be opened from the Pulsar user interface, e.g. from the project tree view, or programmatically through `atom.workspace.open()`.

The PDF.js viewer supports a number of [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-shortcuts), the most important ones are:

| shortcut                                      | function                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>j</kbd>                  | next page               |
| <kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>k</kbd>                  | previous page           |
| <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>                  | find                    |
| <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd>                  | find next               |
| <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd> | find previous           |
| <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd>                  | zoom in                 |
| <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>                  | zoom out                |
| <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>                  | reset zoom              |
| <kbd>r</kbd>                                  | rotate clockwise        |
| <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd>                 | rotate counterclockwise |
| <kbd>F4</kbd>                                 | toggle sidebar          |

Zoom is also possible via <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + the mouse wheel. A click on an internal link scrolls to that position in the document, a click on an external link opens it with the associated application. If modified by <kbd>ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>shift</kbd>, external links are opened in a separate  window.

If the PDF has been generated by *TeX with SyncTeX support, a right click opens the source file in  at the corresponding line.

The package watches for file changes and reloads the PDF if necessary. Viewer panes are persistent across  runs.
